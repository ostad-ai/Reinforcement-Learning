    "# Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "**Reinforcement Learning (RL)** is a subfield of machine learning where an **agent** learns to make decisions by interacting with an **environment**. The agent aims to maximize cumulative rewards by discovering the best actions to take in various states. Unlike supervised learning, RL does not rely on labeled data; instead, it learns through trial and error.\n",

    "### **Definition of Reinforcement Learning**\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning is a framework for solving **sequential decision-making problems** characterized by:\n",
    "1. **Agent**: The learner or decision-maker.\n",
    "2. **Environment**: The world with which the agent interacts.\n",
    "3. **State ($s$)**: A representation of the current situation.\n",
    "4. **Action ($a$)**: A decision taken by the agent in a given state.\n",
    "5. **Reward ($r$)**: Feedback from the environment after taking an action.\n",
    "6. **Policy ($\\pi$)**: A strategy that the agent uses to decide actions based on states.\n",
    "7. **Value Function ($V(s)$ or $Q(s, a)$)**: Estimates the expected cumulative reward of being in a state or taking an action in a state.\n",
    "8. **Discount Factor ($\\gamma$)**: Determines the importance of future rewards (between 0 and 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of RL is to learn an **optimal policy** that maximizes the expected cumulative reward over time.\n",
