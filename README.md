2) **Markov Decision Process:** A Markov decision process (MDP) is a mathematical framework used for modeling decision-making. We have an *agent* (e.g., the robot) that interacts with an *environment* by taking actions, transitioning between states, and receiving rewards. Here, we review the concepts and formulae of MDPs and remind the **Markov property** of them. Finally, we give an example in Python for a simple grid world.
